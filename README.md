Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

About the game: 

Rock paper scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision.


How to play:

The players may count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!" or "Ro Sham Bo!"). People will say "Go!" or "Shoot!" after "Scissors!". Each time either raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count or holding it behind. They then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players throw immediately on the third count (thus throwing on the count of "Scissors!" or "Bo!"), or a version where they shake their hands three times before "throwing".
